                The ITC in 2021 is a 26% federal tax credit for solar systems on residential properties. As the owner of
                the solar energy system, you may be eligible to apply the credit as a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the
                federal income taxes that you owe in the year that your solar system was installed. If the ITC granted
                for your solar system is greater than your tax liabilities in the year that you purchased your solar
                energy system, you may be able to apply the remaining ITC in the subsequent year. To determine your
                eligibility for any federal solar investment tax credit, you should make an independent assessment or
                consult with your tax advisor. Some states and/or utilities offer additional credits and rebates above
                the ITC Tax credit.
